#Remake of Daba website - built from scratch without utilizing any Libary.
This project is my second major Front end project. Prior to this, I had completed a few mini projects following the completion of the Freecodecamp's responsive web design course, a few from frontend mentors and a remake of amulet.gg 
HTML and CSS was mostly used to develop the website. JavaScript was used to create a click event for the nav menu in smaller screens. 
This project is simply to test my basic HTML and CSS skills.
