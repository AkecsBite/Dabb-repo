#Remake of Daba website - built from scratch without utilizing any Libary.
This project is my second major Front end project. Prior to this, I had only completed five mini projects following the completion of the Freecodecamp's responsive web design course. 
HTML and CSS was mostly used to develop the website. JavaScript was used to create a click event for the nav menu in smaller screens. 
This project is simply to test my basic HTML and CSS skills.
